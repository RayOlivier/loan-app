# Loan App (clever name pending) 
This is a WIP portfolio piece inspired by my research into financing a car for the first time. I couldn't find an app to compare multiple loans at once, particularly looking at interest over time.

This small Loan App is a small portfolio piece, built with React + Vite. 

## Libraries Used:
Kor-UI (component library of lit-elements)
Chart.js
React Hook Forms
